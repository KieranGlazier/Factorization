\title{The Hydroplant}

(NOTE: This doesn't exist.)

Probably a multiblock? 7x3x3?

Hydroelectric Turbine Plan
BWL  Book, Water bucket, LMP

Plan must be used in a sufficiently cleared out area.
Has resource requirements:
    27 blocks of iron
    1 motor (or some kind of heavy duty motor?)
    48 iron plates
    5 glass blocks
    3 lead blocks
    2 gold blocks

The amount of power generated is proportional to the amount of water source blocks in a large area near the turbine.
Checks every 4Â³th block in each chunk that is above itself and below the top block. Recursively visits each chunks out to a 8-chunk radius or something.
May be dependent on rain in some way. If it is, since everyone hates rain, it'll probably only require 1 rainstorm per IRL week or something like that.
Doesn't actually remove water or anything.
Probably makes quite the racket.

Must be placed above sealevel. Draining the ocean into the fiery abyss is cheating, and not allowed.
