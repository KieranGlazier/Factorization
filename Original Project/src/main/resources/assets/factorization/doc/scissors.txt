\title{Enormous Scissors}

The scissors are a socket part for cutting blocks and mobs.

A redstone signal will close the scissors.

These scissors can deftly cut blocks like grass and leaves.

They're not the sharpest,
so they do minimal damage to mobs and players.
However, they occasionally snip an extra cut of mob loot.
