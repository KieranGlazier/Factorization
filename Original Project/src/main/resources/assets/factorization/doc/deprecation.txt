The Mixer and the Packager will be removed in 0.9,
since the Compression Crafter can do everything that they can.
Additional features are being added to make up for them!

Charge transimission will be completely rewritten in 0.9, which might require some rewiring, and maybe change generator yields.

The Steam Turbine will be removed soon.

Existing sculptures may not necessarily survive into MC 1.8! (I don't know yet.)

Don't stockpile utility goo.

Usages of silver and lead will be changed out to gold and copper in 0.9.
