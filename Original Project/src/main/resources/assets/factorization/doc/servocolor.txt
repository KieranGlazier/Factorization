\title{Servo Coloring}

\link{servo}{Servos} and \link{servorail}{servo rail} can be colored by placing some dye on them.

Colored servos can travel on rails that have a matching color,
and will completely ignore servo rails that do not match.
% Barring bugs, of course. :P

Uncolored servos can travel on colored rails,
and colored servos can travel on uncolored rails.
