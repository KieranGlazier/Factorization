\title{Goo}

Goo is a builder's swiss army knife!

Right clicking a block with goo will put some goo on that block.
Click on a block with goo on it to spread more goo around.
Punch a gooey block to remove the goo from it,
and the goo around it.
Shift-punch a gooey block to remove just one goo.

Mining a gooey block with the appropriate tool will
mine out all of the other gooey blocks with it.

The gooey blocks can be replaced by clicking on them with a different block.

These two operations have a small chance of causing goo loss.

\newpage
Shift-clicking a goo-freey block with goo will move the other
gooey blocks in that direction.

Clicking & shift-clicking slabs and stairs with an empty hand
will rotate them.
