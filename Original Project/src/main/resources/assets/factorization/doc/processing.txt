\title{The Furnace Heater}

The furnace heater simply heats up adjacent blocks.
It can heat:
\- Furnaces
\- Slag Furnaces
\- Crystallizers

Multiple heaters can be used to decrease the time
it takes to heat up
and smelt faster.

A single heater does not have enough wattage to heat multiple things simultaneously.

\title{The Slag Furnace}
The slag furnace is a furnace specialized for producing slightly more output than a regular furnace.
It has two output slots,
and consumes twice as much fuel as a normal furnace.

It is necessary for extracting both silver and lead from galena ore.


\newpage
\title{The Cystallizer}

This is a simple container in which crystals are grown.

First, a solution is required;
aqua regia is typically used here.
Next, the material to be crystallized must be added.
Then it must be heated up with a furnace heater,
and then be left undisturbed
for 20 minutes to allow
the crystals to grow.

It has six slots,
one of which must contain the solution,
which leaves 5 other slots availabe,
which will be consumed in parallel.

An important crystalline component is
the
\#{item.factorization:logic_matrix}
Logic Matrix,
which are crystallized blocks of redstone.
It would be wise to keep a stock of them
prepared at all times.
