\title{The Repeater}

The repeater is a vanilla redstone component
that propagates a signal fed in through its back.
When it does this, it introduces a 1-tick delay.
Clicking on the repeater will adjust the delay,
which can last for up to 4 ticks.

A repeater can be "locked" by placing another
powered repeater outputting directly to its side.
When locked, a repeater will not change
its output.
