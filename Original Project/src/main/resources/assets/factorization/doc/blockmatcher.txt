\title{Block Matcher}

The Block Matcher is a double-ended block that compares the blocks on both ends.
If the blocks match, then it emits a brief redstone signal.

Comparators can be used to measure more subtle details, and they have a constant output.
If the two blocks have the same solidity (such stone and wool, as opposed to air and logs),
but otherwise have nothing in common, it will output a very weak signal.
If the two blocks are made of the same kinds of materials, a slightly stronger signal will be emitted.
If the blocks are absolutely identical, then the comparator will measure the strongest signal.
