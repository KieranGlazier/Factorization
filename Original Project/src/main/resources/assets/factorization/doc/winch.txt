\title{The Winch}

Combining a \#{factorization.factoryBlock.SOCKET_EMPTY}
with a \#{item.factorization:motor} and a \#{item.factorization:servo/sprocket}
creates a winch.
The winch can be connected to a \link{hinge}{hinged} block using a sturdy chain.
The block must be solid.

Supplying the winch with sufficient \link{charge}{charge} and a redstone signal
will reel in the chain.

A comparator will measure how much chain has been let out.

Charge is conducted through the chain, so \link{socket}{various contraptions} can be powered while
on a hinge.
