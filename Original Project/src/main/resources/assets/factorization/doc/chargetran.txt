\title{Transfering Charge}

Charge is transfered using lead wiring.
Any block that uses charge will conduct it amongst other blocks.
This creates a network.
Charge is distributed evenly among every block in the network.

Machines that use charge generally have
a threshold of charge that they require
before they can start operating,
and will regularly consume some
while operating.
