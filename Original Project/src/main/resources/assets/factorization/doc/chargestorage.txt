\title{Storing Charge}

There are a few ways of storing charge.

One way is to simply have a lot of wiring.
Of course, this requires more space,
can not be measured by a comparator,
and can not be moved by hand.

The battery block stores a relatively small
amount of power,
and they come pre-charged.
It is used in the crafting of motors.
A comparator can measure how full it is.
When broken, it will keep its charge.

The leyden can store a large amount of power.
It is quite cheap to craft,
but is extremely inefficient.
It also requires a large amount of power before
it can even start charging.
Like the battery,
a comparator will measure how full it is,
and it will retain its storage when broken.
