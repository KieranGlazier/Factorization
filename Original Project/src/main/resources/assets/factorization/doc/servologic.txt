\title{Servo Stacks}

Each servo has 2 lists of memory.
You can see the contents of these lists
by looking at the servo with an \lmp\ handy.

The left stack holds values;
when instructions modify a stack, it is typically the left stack.

The right stack holds instructions;
the \link{instructions/subroutine}{Subroutine} instruction will add other instructions to this stack.
The instructions will be popped from the stack and executed until the stack is empty.
