\title{The Piston}

The piston is a redstone contraption that, when powered, pushes blocks.
They can push lines of blocks, but no more than 12 blocks, and not obsidian,
nor tile entities, nor extended pistons.

A variety of piston is the sticky piston.
When a sticky piston retracts,
it will bring the block in front of it along with it.
If it recieves a 1-tick pulse,
such as from a \link{gate/pulse}{Pulse Limiter},
it will not pull a block when it retracts if it has just pushed it.

Pistons are infamous for recieving power diagonally.
If they stop being powered diagonally,
they will not retract until they recieve a block update.
This can be exploited to create a block update detector.
