\title{The Mixer}

The mixer is an electrically powered machine that crafts shapeless recipes.
It has 4 input slots, and 4 outputs slots.

When mixing, items are allowed to be spread out
in ways that would not work in normal crafting tables.
For example, 1 stack of bowls, 2 stacks of red mushrooms,
and 1 stack of brown mushrooms will successfully craft mushroom stew.

It requires \link{charge}{charge} to operate.
If kept stocked with a sufficient supply of crafting materials,
its crafting speed will slowly accelerate.

Crafting ingredients are inserted into the top and sides of the machine,
and crafting results are extracted from the bottom.
