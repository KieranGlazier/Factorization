\title{The Screw Pump}

The screwpump transfers liquids from behind it to in front of it.

If there is a body of liquid behind it,
it will drain from it.

It can also drain from tanks.

If there's a tank in front of the screwpump,
then it will fill the tank.
Otherwise it will flood into empty spaces,
up to 7 blocks above the screw pump.
Any tanks that are in the flooding area will be filled.
