\title{Twisted Block of Dark Iron}

Dark Iron is the only block in the known universe
that can be bent against the alignment of reality with minimal fuss.
Simply slap a sprocket on, and give it a twist!

Other blocks can be placed against the dark iron block
(up to a point),
and the original block can be removed if desired.

Placing a Twisted Block against another turned dark iron block will not,
as some have feared,
form a world-devlouring black hole;
instead it will merely twist the original block slightly.
It's perfectly safe!

The same may not be true of all \i{other} blocks;
it would be wise to keep bold experimentation well away from any planet you have fondness for.
