\title{The Hall of Legends}

The Hall of Legends holds near-broken tools until the eventuality that they can be repaired.

Only a limited number of Hall of Legends can exist in the universe;
there can be only one per class of dimension.

The Hall of Legends accepts one artifact every 5 days.
(If you think this means it takes less than 2 hours, you are quite mistaken.)

Clicking on the block with a tool will submit it.
The tool must be nearly broken, and also must be named and enchanted;
artifacts made by the \link{artifactforge}{Artifact Forge} will be suitable,
as will tools created by more standard means.

Once there are at least seven tools in the Hall of Legends,
the earliest submitted tool can be removed by punching the block.
This will give you the shards of the tool,
which can then be repaired by combining the shards
with the appropriate repair item at the anvil for 30 levels.

The Hall will automatically display the shards of the tools it is holding
in any nearby unoccupied posters.
The name will be written on a sign,
if there are any signs next to the poster.
Posters that have shards in them can not be touched by any mortal means.
If you want to move the posters around,
you must punch the Hall with a poster;
this will remove the shards from the posters.
Punching the block with a poster again will
put the shards back into the posters.

A redstone signal is emitted when an artifact can be submitted.
