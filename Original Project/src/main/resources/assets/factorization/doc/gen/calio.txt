\title{Caliometric Burner}

The caliometric burner converts food into heat,
and should be placed next to a \link{gen/boiler}{boiler}.

In addition to standard foods, the boiler can also consume
\link{gen/anthro}{Entheas}, \link{gen/saptap}{Sap}, and \link{gen/pollen}{Pollen}.

A well-fed caliometric burner emits as much thermal energy as 16 mirrors,
and it is suggested to use more than one burner.

Those unfamiliar with how eating works on this planet should note that food enters through the mouth.
