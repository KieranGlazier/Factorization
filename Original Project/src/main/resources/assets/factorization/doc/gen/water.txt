\title{Water Power}

The waterwheel extracts power from rivers and other sources of flowing water.

Waterwheels are built out of logs and other wooden blocks such as planks, slabs, stairs, fences, and fence gates.

Unlike the \link{gen/wind}{windmill}, the waterwheel doesn't tilt the blocks down,
so the direction that fences point will change as they spin.

The waterwheel base can also be used to build lavawheels; such lavawheels must be built out of metal blocks.
