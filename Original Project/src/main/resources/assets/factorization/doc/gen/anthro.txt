\title{The Anthropic Generator}

These small lanterns accumulate energy from villagers and similar folk as they go about their lives.
This energy is \#{item.factorization:entheas} Entheas,
a very potent foodstuff,
but eating it is... inadvisable.
Fortunately the \link{gen/calio}{Caliometric Burner}, lacking a heart, is immune to the poison.

Entheas is converted to charge just like \link{gen/saptap}{sap}.
