\title{The Sap Tap}

There's more than one way to harvest energy from the sun.
Trees have been collecting sunlight long before mankind first reflected it onto \link{gen/boiler}{Solar Boilers}!
The Sap Tap extracts a thick and foul-tasting sap from trees.
It is quite unpalatable, but the \link{gen/calio}{Caliometric Burner}, having no tongue, won't notice.
Small trees do not produce sufficient sap to be worthwhile;
large custom trees produce the best output.

The sap tap must be placed underneath a log.

A good sap-producing tree will have hundreds of logs, and many more leaves;
the \link{leafbomb}{Leaf Bomb} may be useful here.

Placing multiple sap taps nearby might anger the trees, so as a safety precaution this is not allowed.

Sap can be converted into charge by feeding it to a \link{gen/calio}{Caliometric Burner}
adjacent to \link{gen/boiler}{Boiler}
with a \link{gen/whirligig}{Whirligig} and \link{gen/charge}{Charge Generator} above.
