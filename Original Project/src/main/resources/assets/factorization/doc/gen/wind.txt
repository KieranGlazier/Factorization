\title{Wind Power}

The windmill can be used to harness the power of the wind!

The windmill base has two sides, the shaft side and, opposite of that, the log side.
A \link{gen/charge}{Charge Generator} or a \link{gen/shaft}{shaft} should be connected to the shaft side.

A fence or log should be placed on the other side to begin building the windmill blades.

Good building materials for windmills are planks, logs, wool, fences, and carpet.
The larger they are, the more power they produce.
Windmills must be symetrical.

Windmills can be horizontal or vertical.
Blocks on horizontal windmills are turned sideways, so that fences will point out instead of up.

A redstone signal will stop the windmill.

The \link{chargemeter}{Charge Meter} will measure various properties of the windmill,
including efficiency and windspeed.
