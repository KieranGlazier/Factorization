\title{The Boiler}

The boiler uses heat and water to create steam.
The heat can come from \link{gen/mirror}{mirrors}, or from \link{gen/calio}{caliometric burners}.
The boiler can suck in water from an infinite source block below,
or, alternatively,
water can be piped in from the bottom.

Boilers can be stacked on top of one another;
in this case steam and water will be sent upwards.

The steam is ejected out of the top-most boiler.
