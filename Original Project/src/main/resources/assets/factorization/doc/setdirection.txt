\title{Set Direction\#{item.factorization:servo/component.fz.instruction.setdirection}}

When a servo hits this instruction,
it will attempt to go in the direction it is pointing.
The direction can be changed by right-clicking with an \lmp .

If it can not actually go that way,
it will at the next opportunity.
(Unless it is later told to go in a different direction.)
