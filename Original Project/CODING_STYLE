* Indentation is 4 spaces. I blame society.
* Opening braces go on the same line. I will cut you.
* Do not use reflection to poke at Minecraft's privates; always use the AT.
* Make use of Coord, ForgeDirection, and Vec3; avoid decomposing them. All world+pos operations are available via Coord, including handy things like "spawn this ItemStack as an Entity"
* Use DataHelper for serialization; one of these days I'll convert the old stuff to use it, and things will be prettier.
* Lay methods out in a "guarded style". Error/bad states are filtered out early using early return; "the happy path" goes on the bottom
* Invert if cases to reduce indentation. In general, indentation is to be avoided.
* Early returns/continues should be in an inline if. Correctional actions and repetitive patterns should also be inline. Everything else should be in a block.
* When overriding MC methods, always rename the parameters to something sensible.
* Common variable names: 'is' is "the itemstack", 'te' is "the tileentity", 'at' is "the hither Coord", 'it' is "the iterator", 'player' (not entityplayer, or similar verbose waste) is "the player", 'held' is "the itemstack held by the player"
* If you are working with decomposed coordinates (and for some reason you aren't using a Coord...) use names like 'x' rather than the asinine 'xPos' or 'xCoord'. (Unless, of course, you're dealing with multiple sets. Have I mentioned Coord?)
* Chat messages are very very rarely the appropriate; use Notice's.
* Name constants by putting them in, at the very least, a local variable.
* Don't repeat expressions; extract repeated computations to a local variable.
* Small oft-repeated snippets of code, such as "interpolate between two values" or "convert 0-sized stack to null", can be found/should be put in FzUtil.
* All inventory manipulation should be done through FzInv, via in FzUtil.openInventory(). Inventory manipulation has many corner-cases, and FzInv protects you from them.
* Adding magic blocks is a syntax error.
* If you're feeling compelled to comment what something is doing, then you've probably chosen bad names. The why's are cool for commenting tho.
* Mind the @SideOnly's.
* neptune doesn't check XXX/TODO. FIXME usually means Forge needs some feature or something. NORELEASE is where the beef is at, and means "don't do a release without looking at this first". The check_norelease script will list them.
